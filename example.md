Finally, don't miss <http://example3.com>.

Unordered list:

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

A longer one:

  * this is a long, multi-line paragraph. It
    seems to go on and on.

  * this is a long, multi-line paragraph. It
    seems to go on and on.

        Here's a code block
        within the list item.

    Here's a second paragraph, still part of
    the 2nd item.

  * this is a long, multi-line paragraph. It
    seems to go on and on.

Numbered lists
====
Numbered:

 1. won
 2. too
 3. tree

definitions
=======

Term 1
~ Definition 1

Term 2
  ~ Definition 2a
  ~ Definition 2b


#### Definition list ####
Term 1
:   Definition 1
Term 2 with *inline markup*
:   Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

    Third paragraph of definition 2.

Done.

tables
====

A table:

Size  Color   Fragrance
----  ------  ----------------
9     Red     Excelsior
10    Blue    Icey Cool
8     Green   Breezy Meadow

A multi-line table:

-------------------------------------------
Orientation  Reasoning
-----------  ------------------------------
leftward     Because it works well under
             extreme depths and pressures.

spinward     There's no reason to use
             spinward. It will only
             cause apoplexia.
-------------------------------------------

rules
====
Done.


Here's a horizontal rule:

***

One minor footnote [^1] to be aware of.

[^1]: footnote text goes here.

You can simply <span class="yo">add html</span>,
if necessary. You can also escape to LaTeX-formatted
math: $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$.

<!-- This is a long comment,
     spanning multiple lines.
     -->


Pandoc Markdown doesn't have these. You
might try for a similar effect like so:

| **Name**: Fluxor
| **Planet of origin**: Betatron 5
| **Special Skills**: Invisibility, Scent matching

or maybe put them into a table, or a definition list.
